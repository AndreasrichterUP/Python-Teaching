    "In case of unbalanced classes, e.g. only few positive and a lot of negative data-points the classification accuracy is an insuffi- cient performance measure as a classifier that would predict the negative class for the whole dataset would earn a very high accu- racy without any correct prediction of the positive class. Receiver Operator Characteristics (ROC- curves) serve as basis for an in- dependent measure of performance (ROCAUC) which is widely used for such cases in machine learning. The ROC-curve shows a diagram with the false-positive rate ( P(FP), specificity or FPR, horizontal axis) vs. the true-positive rate ( P(TP), sensitivity or TPR, vertical axis) of a classifier. Both relative frequencies speci- ficity & sensitivity are evaluated at any cutpoint between the two class distributions and displayed in a diagram which represents the trade-off between them. (cf. figure 13) For practical usage a two-digit number of cutpoints is sufficient to approximate the ROC-curve. The interpretation of the curve is easy comprehensi- ble if for example the discrimination of the used classifier is very good the false-positive rate is very low while the true-positive rate is relative high. This results in a very steep curve which also means that the area under the curve is high"
